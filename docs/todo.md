"About This Project
Welcome to [Your Website Name], a dedicated resource hub for developers, researchers, and enthusiasts exploring the fascinating world of legacy game engines, SDKs, software, and plugins. Our mission is to preserve and provide access to these valuable tools and resources, ensuring they remain available for educational, historical, and creative purposes.

Why This Exists
In the fast-paced world of technology, many groundbreaking tools and engines from the past risk being lost or forgotten. These legacy resources, however, hold immense value. They serve as a foundation for learning, innovation, and inspiration. By cataloging and sharing them, we aim to:

Educate: Provide a comprehensive library of resources for students, hobbyists, and professionals to study and learn from.

Preserve: Ensure that historically significant software and tools remain accessible for future generations.

Inspire: Encourage creativity and experimentation by making these resources available to the community.

What We Offer
Our website is structured as a wiki-like repository, offering detailed information and resources for:

Game Engine Source Code: Explore the inner workings of iconic engines like X-RAY, DOOM 3, Far Cry 1, and Unreal Engine 3.

SDKs: Access software development kits such as Havok and PS4 SDKs, complete with documentation and tutorials.

Software: Discover tools like Endorphin, which have shaped the way we create and animate.

Plugins: A growing collection of plugins to extend the functionality of legacy tools.

Each resource is accompanied by documentation, tutorials, and examples to help you get started.

Our Ethos
We believe in the power of open knowledge and collaboration. This project is built on the principles of:

Accessibility: Making resources available to everyone, regardless of their background or experience level.

Community: Encouraging contributions from users to expand and improve the repository.

Respect: Honoring the intellectual property and legacy of the creators behind these tools.
